# 3D-from-2D-images-comp-vision

Program developed in Matlab R2018a and R2018b.

To run the program, open mainVC.m and run it.

The calibration sessions for each camera are included in separate folders, aswell as the images taken for testing.

Program doesn't always return the same 3-D structure from the images when running. 

For safety, an example of a working structure was saved and can be found choosing options 2 or 4 of the mainVC.m program.
